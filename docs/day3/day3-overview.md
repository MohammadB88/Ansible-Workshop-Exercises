# Overview

Workshop Day 3 is about some additional tools and the Ansible future.
We will take a look at the Ansible Navigator, a command line utility and text-based user interface (TUI) for running and developing Ansible automation content.  
Furthermore, we will do a small project and automate network infrastructure with Ansible.

## Who will use automation content navigator?
The automation content navigator is mainly geared towards developers of automation. This can mean people creating automated tasks with available modules, those migrating roles into Collections or those who are developing modules from the ground up. Content navigator runs as a textual user interface and looks great within a terminal session, even while running inside popular code editors with included terminal panes.
